#### Makers Academy (November to February)

Test Driven Development
 
During the Makers Academy course I learnt many valuable skills especially when it comes to coding, for example TDD was an extremely important skill which i employed in 
both my example projects above. This was very useful skill as it allowed us to build and work around a very solid test framework
and then add more and more complexity to the program as we went.

Object Oriented Design

This skill was vital in our 'This Day in History' final project for the Makers Academy course. We used this skill by taking a substantial time of our project being the 
first two full days to plan both using a trello board to break down ideas into smaller more managable sections which we could work on in pairs, but also we made use of
diagramming which allowed us to get a much better picture of what we wanted our final website to look and work like.


## Work Experience

**The Victoria** (March,2022-December,2022)  
_Waiter_

-Teamworking & Communication
This was really important especially on busy days and/or on events where the whole restaurant was booked. This teamwork was essential to keep everything running 
smoothly, not only on the floor but between the wait staff the bar staff and the kitchen.

-Conflict resolution
This was vital when mishaps happened in any part of the business, esxpecially with customers orders, being able to quicky deal with any problems they may have was 
extremely important in keeping all our guests satisfied with service, and being able to resolve any isuess quickly was important in keeping service fast.


## Education 
Currently I have only gone so far as to completing my A-levels in which i achieved:

Mathmatics - A

Further Mathmatics - C

Physics - B

#### Any other qualifications

That in some arguable way make you a better software developer or well-rounded person

## Hobbies
Currently my hobbies include powerlifting, snowboarding and sailing also I spent 4 years rowing 2 of which were on the clubs race team and I spent 13 years
participating in karate.
